They fall in your hair. They crawl on your car. They hang in your face. It’s a surefire sign that spring is approaching: lime green or yellow worms, an inch or so long, start to dangle from silk strands on trees around Florida in March. So what are they? According to the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, the skinny, wriggly caterpillars are probably oak leaftiers (Croesia semipurpurana) or oak leafrollers/ inchworms(Archips semiferanus). The critters munch on the leaves of oak trees before creating a cocoon and becoming oak leaftier moths or oak leafrollers. While the critters can drop in at inopportune times, they are nothing more harmful than a seasonal nuisance, UF reports. Whether you find the bright little caterpillars annoying or adorable, get used to them, at least for a few weeks.
